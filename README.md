# Elasmobranch
> The [Elasmobranches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasmobranchii) are a subclass of fish that includes sharks. Sharks have a near 360Â° field of vision and can see even in murky water due to their [tapetum lucidum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapetum_lucidum). In other words, they can C#.

This repository records my progress in learning to code in C# as part of the A-Level Computer Science course.

## Project Structure

### Running the code
I am coding this in the latest stable release of [Jetbrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/). The project should compatible with (or at the very least importable into) Microsoft's [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) too.

The `Elasmobranch` directory contains the code, all the functions I write and so on. The `Tests` directory contains classes and code that tests the functions in the `Elasmobranch` directory.
